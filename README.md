🛠️ Hi, I'm Muhammad Riyaz (aka Pixelsmith)
Web Enthusiast | Creative Coder | Lifelong Learner
I’m a hobbyist developer driven by curiosity about how the digital world is built. While I started with a focus on the visual side of the web, I’m currently diving deep into the "engine room" to understand how everything connects.

🚀 What I’m Up To
• 🎨 Frontend: Crafting "awesome web stuff" with a focus on clean UI/UX.
• ⚙️ Backend: Currently exploring server-side logic, databases, and how data flows.
• 🧪 Experimenting: Building small projects to understand the inner workings of programming.

🤝 Let's Collaborate!
I am highly open to collaborating on open-source projects or fun side-hustles. My main goal is learning by doing, so if you have a project and don't mind a pair of curious hands, I'm in!

🛠️ My Toolbox
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
Backend: NodeJS, Express, MySQL

⚡ Fun Fact
Programming is my playground! I’m learning web development as a hobby because I love deconstructing complex systems to see what makes them tick.
